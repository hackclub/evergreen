# Evergreen 🌲

Evergreen was Hack Club's 9th [Day of Service](https://daysofservice.hackclub.com/), an initiative started to bridge the gender gap in technology. We organized a day of coding in partnership with a local school district, the [Renton School District](https://www.rentonschools.us/)!

On May 3rd, 2024, a group of Hack Clubbers gathered to host a 1-day hackathon for local students. By the end of the day, we had a variety of projects, such as circuit board designs, 3D modeling mockups, and even generative art that we drew with a robot arm! 🤖

***This repo is meant to serve as a point of reference for anyone wanting to organize their own Day of Service! If you have any other questions, reach out to [@FireBreather65](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U05J46STSS2) on Slack. You can also view our open-source planning in the Hack Club Slack #evergreen channel!***

## Our goals 🎯
Like past Days of Service events such as Horizon, Alpine, Think Like a Programmer, and Blossom, our goal was two-fold:

1. To support Hack Clubbers to become more technical, become better leaders, and deepen friendships through fun, collaborative coding projects.
2. To grow Hack Club’s community so it is inclusive and accessible to teenagers of all backgrounds. We made active outreach to under-represented, marginalized gender & race minorities, who lack access to computer science programs or professional mentors in their community.

## Our workshops 🧩
Evergreen had 3 different workshop tracks: [Blot](https://blot.hackclub.dev), [OnBoard](https://blot.hackclub.dev), and [3D Village](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/3d-club-village)! Here's an overview of all of them:

#### Blot
In this workshop, students learned JavaScript and created generative art!
Thank you to [@Michelle](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U06D7NTBDCY) and [@Sahiti](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U03RU99SGKA) from [Blossom](https://blossom.hackclub.com) for helping us prep for the wokrshop and prepare the slides :)

#### OnBoard
In this workshop, students learned the fundamentals of circuit board design in EasyEDA with Hack Club's OnBoard program!

#### 3D Village
In this workshop, students learned the fundamentals of 3D modeling in Spline, a web-based 3D design tool!

## Our dinner 🍽️
![1714886366912](https://github.com/FireBreather65/evergreen-fork/assets/76709163/f982aa46-54d4-460f-9541-926dd484fb76)

After the hackathon, we had an amazing dinner at the Chihuly Garden and Glass Museum! In attendance were 19 STEM professionals, 13 Hack Clubbers, 12 Renton high schoolers, and 2 staff members.

One of the most memorable moments from the dinner is when we heard a shocking statistic: men tend to apply for jobs when they only have 50% of the requirements, whereas women typically apply when they have about 90% of requirements! This is the kind of self-doubt and feeling of impostor syndrome that can emerge from being a minority in tech.
